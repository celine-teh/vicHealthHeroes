# Project Description 

This project aims to provide a centralised platform to bridge the gap between healthcare volunteers and the vulnerable in regional and rural Victoria.  This objective of this website is to address the healthcare discrepancy between urban and rural areas of Victoria by including volunteers in aiding the rural population to attain quality healthcare. 

# Problem Statement 
Nearly 23% of the Victorians live in rural and regional areas, where they face inequality in health services because of increased distance from healthcare facilities and their socio-economic status. This has caused them to have shorter longevity, higher rates of disease and injury, as well as limited access to healthcare services despite the availability of telehealth services.  Volunteers wish to play a role in assisting remote Victoria in improving their accessibility and awareness towards quality healthcare but lack the means to do so.

# Target Audience 
The intended target audience of this web application is young adults ranging from 20 to 30 years old from urban areas of Victoria with a passion for volunteering for social causes.
